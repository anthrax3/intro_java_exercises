Goal: Implement a class called ArrayCalculator.

Description:

1) Create a new class called ArrayCalculator
2) Create the following static methods:
  a) int sum(int[] x)
  b) float avg(int[] x)
  c) int median(int[] x)
  d) int mode(int[] x)
3) Create a new class called CalculatorRunner that includes a main method
