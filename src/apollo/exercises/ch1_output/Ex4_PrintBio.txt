Create a new class called PrintBio. This class should output a brief bio
of yourself to the output. For example, it can contain your name, your 
occupation, and your favorite Android app.

Step 1) Create a new class: http://d.pr/i/7Mki
Step 2) Fill out the class wizard: http://d.pr/i/z9tQ
Step 3) Add the println statements for you bio.

Bonus: Try printing your bio using only ONE println statement.
       Try using string concatenation, which can span multiple lines.
       
       System.out.println("Hello " +
         "There");
